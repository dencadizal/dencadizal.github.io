This is my personal website showing my skills and other work related stuff. This is created with the help of Anthropic's Claude.

The current theme of the website is mainly a simplistic and basic design approach. There are light and dark mode version for easy
viewing for the audience. While this is created with the help of Claude, the website will be adjusted from time to time.

For the time being, this website will be live while creating a more personal website which showcases not just work-related experience,
but a personality and the things that I like. (like games, anime and arts).
